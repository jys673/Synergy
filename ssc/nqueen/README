Introduction

This directory contains the following programs:

a) a sequential N-Queen solver
b) a parallel N-Queen solver without XDR
c) a parallel N-Queen solver with XDR.

An N-Queen solver finds all legal positions of placing N queens in an NxN chess board.

This example illustrates how to partition a recursive program for parallel
processing. This is a deterministic recursive program in the sense that the
sequential effective calcution steps are the same as parallel effective
calculation steps.

The sequential runs on a Sun SparcII processor produced the following results:

To make different binaries:

a) %make queen  -- makes the sequential binary.
b) %make nxdr 	-- makes the parallel binaries without xdr data handling.
c) %make xdr	-- makes the parallel binaries with xdr data handling. 

The execution results are stored in the following files:

a) ./nq_seq.time 	-- sequential execution results.
b) ~/nq_nxdr.time	-- parallel execution results without xdr. 
c) ~/nq_xdr.time 	-- parallel execution results with xdr.

Note that the parallel stat files are to be found in your home directory.
The stat results are appended to the files after each run.
