A description of the contents follows:

lap.c, lap.h 
------------
	Program lap.c is the sequential version of the solution of 
two-dimensional Laplace equation (an elliptic PDE). For details please
refer to the header of the file lap.c

        To run this program
-- set parameters in lap.h
-- build executable "lap" using make
-- run   


lapclnt.c, lapwrk.c, lap.csl, lap.h
-----------------------------------
	Program lapclnt.c is the client, lapwrk.c is the worker, and lap.csl
is the csl file for the parallel solution of the two-dimensional Laplace 
equation. For details, please refer to the header of lapclnt.c and lapwrk.c.

	To run the parallel version on Synergy
-- set parameters in lap.h
-- build executables "lapclnt" and "lapwrk" using make
-- set parameters in lap.csl
       factor: no. of calibraion iterations. Set a value (Larger the value
               larger is the calibration time. A calibration time more than
               15 sec. should be O.K. Suggested range (50 for DIM >= 500;
               500 for DIM = 100-200). You control load balancing using
  	       factor. If the system is highly unstable use still larger
               value.

    thresold:  provides explicit synchronization. suggested range (20 - 110).
               Smaller the thresold higher is the explicit synchronization
               and more is the time spent on communication. A value over 100
               means no explicit synchonization. 

-- run using "prun lap &"


A Note On Load Balancing
========================
	A perfect load balance means all the worker end their respective 
iterations almost at the same time without explicit synchronization using
thresold in lap.csl. Attempt should be made to achieve a satisfactory
load balance using factor in lap.csl. If the system does not permit reasonable
load balance, start decreasing thresold from 100 in steps till you a get a
better result in terms of maximum residual obtained and time spent. A value
of thresold less than 20 might result in excessive communication and hence
might give worse result.


Global residual
===============
	An acceptable value of the global residual depends upon an application.
Should it be more than 0.05 attempts should be made to decrease it by doing
one or more of the followin:

-- increase factor to do better load balancing
-- increase MAXITER
-- increase synchronization by decreasing thresold


Good Luck!
