1. What is it?

This is an re-engineered code by John Timlin of Temple Graphics Inc. for
converting raw census data into Temple graph internal format. 

The sequential program takes about 40 minutes to convert 80MB raw data.
On a smaller test data set (1.8MB), it takes 62 second on an Alpha processor.

2. What to see?

The parallel version uses 4 variously equipted Alpha processors and finished
the same 1.8MB data conversion in 15 seconds.

3. Misc. Information

The file names are hard coded in the program convlnt.c and a file named "config.sys". Please modify them before running.
