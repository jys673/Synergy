		    Synergy V3.0 Evaluation Release
                     Example Synergy Applications
		   (Solution Space Compact Examples)

These algorithms have compact solution spaces. This means that a parallel
processing scheme will need at least 1/p share of the corresponding
sequential processing steps. Matrix multiplication is an example. 

The following subdirectories deal with a variety of ssc problems:

	fractal 	-- a parallel Mandelbrot system,
				an ideal testbed for load balancing algorithms.
	xepp		-- a parallel interactive Mandelbrot system,
				a program transplanted from PVM.
	matrix		-- a parallel matrix multiplication system.
	gauss		-- a parallel linear solver using Gaussian Elimination,
				a demo of complex program-to-program 
				synchronization and communication using 
				multiple tuple space objects.
	nqueen		-- a parallel N-Queen solver, it finds all possible
				legal placements of N Queens in an NxN chess 
				board. A deterministic recursive program 
				example.
	laplace		-- a parallel heat transfer simulation program using
				a relaxed fixed point algorithm.
	raytrace	-- a parallel ray tracer using POV and Synergy.
	albm		-- a matrix multiplication example. This program
				can automatically balance the fluctuating
				work loads of heterogeneous processors
				delivering near optimal speedup.

Please read the individual README files for detailed instructions.

Note:
  These examples are projects from CIS750, CIS669 and CIS673 courses.
They were rudimentally tested. Please report any problems to 
shi@falcon.cis.temple.edu.
