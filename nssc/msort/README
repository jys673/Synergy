		         Parallel Mergesort

This example illustrates the use of pipes in parallel programs
via a toy mergesort system. It contains four parallel sorters,
a spliter and a merger. For the given data file, no speedup can
be atained. It is possible to obtain better speedup for larger
data sizes. However, the prospects are NOT good. The main reason
for this is that sort is NOT a compute intense application [see
$SNG_PATH/docs/tmodels.ps for explanations].

There is no parameter to adjust. If this system runs on a cluster
with more than one file system, attention must be paid to the
location of the input file. This location must be specified in
msort.csl to make the system run properly.

You may try to use specific processor assignments. Theoretically
they should produce the same results as automatic assignments.
