These algorithms's solution spaces are not compact. This meeans that 
a parallel implementation of the same algorithm can enjoy time savings
that are not possible for a sequential impelementation. For example, an
insertion sort algorithm does not have a compact solution space. This is
because the parallel calculation of the decomposed input elements requires
less than 1/p share of the total sequential steps (a possible superlinear 
speedup). For example, ignoring overhead, (n^2)/p > (n/p)^2, for p > 1. 

One characteristic of non-solution space compact algorithms is that they
can be solved by independent processing of decomposed domains.

The following three subdirectories deal with more complex problems:

	msort		-- a parallel bubble sort example using pipes.
	knapsack	-- a parallel 0/1 knapsack solver (NP-complete). 
	subsetsum	-- a parallel sum of subsets solver (NP-complete).
	tsppar          -- a parallel Traveling Salesman solver (NP-complete).

Except for msort, for selected inputs, all of them can deliver superlinear 
speedups. The fine grain data transmission method used in msort prevents it
from achieving any speedup for small input sizes.

Please read the individual README files for detailed instructions.

Note:
  These examples are projects from CIS750, CIS669 and CIS673 courses.
They were rudimentally tested. Please report any problems to 
shi@falcon.cis.temple.edu.
